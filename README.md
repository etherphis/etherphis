# 🚀 Etherphis: Architect of Digital Realms

**`Master of Code, Digital Sorcery, and Embedded Realms`**

Greetings, wanderer of the digital and embedded realms! I am Etherphis, a seasoned Fullstack Developer, Software Engineer, and Craftsman of Hardware, on a quest to reshape the very fabric of the internet and beyond. My coding journey began at the tender age of 12, with my maiden project being a Discord bot crafted in JavaScript using Discord.js and the NodeJS runtime. This initiation marked the inception of my digital odyssey, and since then, I've evolved into a maestro of frontend craftsmanship, an architect of digital realities, and a sorcerer of embedded systems.
